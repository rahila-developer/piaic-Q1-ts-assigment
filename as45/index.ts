// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function createCar(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...options: (string | number)[]): any {
    const carInfo: { [key: string]: string | number } = {
      manufacturer: manufacturer,
      modelName: modelName,
    };
  
    for (let i = 0; i < options.length; i += 2) {
      const key = options[i] as string;
      const value = options[i + 1] as string | number;
      carInfo[key] = value;
    }
  
    return carInfo;
  }
  
  // Call the function with required and optional information
  const car = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", "color", "blue", "year", 2022);
  
  console.log(car);
  
  

  export {};
